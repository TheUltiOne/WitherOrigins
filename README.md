    Your Human counterpart is not strong enough to let you fully evolve, holding you back.
~ Always spawns with a Stone Sword
~ Spawns in the Nether Fortress
~ Is undead, therefore potion effects are reversed and gets more damage from the Smite enchantment.
~ 3 blocks tall (Pehkui version only)
- Deals less damage
- Cursed: is unlucky
- Curse of the Wither: You have to kill any entity regularly to stay alive.
- More exhaustion in sunlight. (can be countered by wearing a Leather Tunic or any Helmet [not mob heads/pumpkins])
